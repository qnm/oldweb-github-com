<h3>IAMA...</h3>
<p>
I'm a programmer, currently living and working in Sydney, Australia but originally from Dundee, Scotland. My first paid role was an IT tech, but I quickly moved into
web development after I graduated from my Computing degree. Whilst being a PHP programmer is far from glamorous, at the time it was - and to a point still is - a great
language for quickly building websites.
</p>

<p>
I started experimenting with Ruby and Rails for some side-projects back in 2007, and after leaving Yahoo! in 2009 I took a full-time Rails develpoment role. I have 
a lot of fun coding in Rails, but am developing a soft-spot for Haskell. Time will tell what my next move is.
</p>

<p>Outside of nerdy things, I love spending time playing with my sons, and relaxing with my wife, generally not at the same time. I love football (soccer) and whilst
 a pretty mediocre player, will turn up to play come rain, hail or sun. I also really enjoy films, particuarly sci-fi (of course) and abstract work that
 makes me think.</p>

<h3>This is...</h3>
<p>This is my blog. There are many others like it, but this one is mine. I've been keeping this blog since around 2005. Originally I ran Wordpress
hosted by the wonderful folk over at <a href="http;//bur.st">bur.st</a>. Since then, I've migrated to tumblr, and to posterous. Recently I've begun to eschew
online social platforms, and so I've moved the blog to a static site, powered by <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>, and hosted
by the ever-more-awesome <a href="http://github.com">Github</a></p>

<p>I blog about anything and everything, although generally posts are inline with my rather geeky tastes.</p>

<h3>Elsewhere online...</h3>
<p>I do a stuff online at some of these places:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/qnm">Github</a>: Code and More</li>
    <li><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=qnm">Hacker News</a>: Hackery Comments and Submissions</li>
