title: All About Rob Sharp
---
<p>
I'm a programmer, currently living and working in Sydney, Australia but originally from Dundee, Scotland.
</p>

<p>
I moved to Sydney for love (and the warmer weather) and that love resulted in 3 beatiful boys.
</p>

<p>
I generally code in Ruby, but have previously worked in many other languages, most recently PHP. I try not to do that too often.
</p>

<p>
I also have <a href="/resume.html">my resume</a> online.
