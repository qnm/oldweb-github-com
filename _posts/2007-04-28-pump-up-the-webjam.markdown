<a href="http://webjam.com.au/">Webjam</a> is back for round three (and I'm running out of jam-related puns), to be held at the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Level+4%2C+52+King+Street%2C+Sydney,+Sydney,+New+South+Wales+">Jam Bar in Hotel CBD</a> on the <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/178190/export/">7th June</a>.

The <a href="http://www.sharp.id.au/webjam-20/">last Webjam</a> was great fun, with some excellent presentations, some excellent breakdancing, and Microsoft even shouted us a beer. Not many events can claim that!

See you there!
