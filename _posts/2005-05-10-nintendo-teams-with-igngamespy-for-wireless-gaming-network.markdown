"Nintendo has teamed up with IGN/Gamespy to offer a Wi-Fi gaming network to allow gamers to compete across the internet. This is vaguely interesting, except for the fact that they&apos;ve announced their first game: Animal Crossing DS. The first Animal Crossing was a love-it-or-hate-it thing, but I&apos;ll give you one look inside my Animal Crossing lunchbox to determine my position. Being able to trade things wireless over the internet will finally give me a reason to turn on my DS again." <a href="http://press.nintendo.com/articles.jsp?id=6849">Check out the press release<a/>. <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/home-entertainment/ds/nintendo-teams-with-igngamespy-for-wireless-gaming-network-102965.php">[via Gizmodo]</a>.
