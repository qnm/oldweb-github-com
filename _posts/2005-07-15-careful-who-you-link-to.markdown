Well, not in this case, but the <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/">Melbourne Age</a> reports that a Stephen Cooper, a former policeman had 'breached the Copyright Act in authorising the infringement of copyright by â€œpermitting or sanctioning and facilitatingâ€ the infringement through his web site'.
