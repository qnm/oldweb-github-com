Whilst looking for something else, I found a rather interesting way of <a href="http://www.xml.com/lpt/a/2003/06/04/xslt-svg.html">visualising xslt documents</a> as svg over at <a href="http://www.xml.com">xml.com</a>. Considering how complicated some of my xslt has become, I think I&apos;ll try to create some flows using this method.
