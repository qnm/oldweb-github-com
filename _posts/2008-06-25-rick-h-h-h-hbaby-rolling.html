<p>Recently, my wee lad has discovered the ability to roll from his back to front, and is just about strong enough to hold himself up. This is good. What isn’t so great is that he’s not yet worked out how to roll from his front to back.</p>
<p>This has caused a bit of grief in our household, debating who has to get up at 0230 to pick up our little dude and set him on his back. Moreover, there’s always the risk that he’ll somehow not be able to let us know his distress, although I think this is quite a low risk – he <i>always</i> lets us know his distress!</p>
<p>My wife and I investigated a few products designed to stop this rolling, but being Scottish, I didn’t want to lay out a wedge for what was effectively a sponge wedge, so set about thinking how we could achieve the same without bending over and taking it from Babies Galore <b>again</b>.</p>
<p>What I hadn’t counted on was the ingenuity of mrs quannum, who has clearly been watching old editions of MacGuyver on her maternity leave. She came up with this awesome hack using towels and rubber bands, which results in a good nights sleep for all of us!</p>
