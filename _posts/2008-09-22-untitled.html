<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote"><p>President Bush and his supporters can find $700 billion to spend on a war of choice. Almost overnight, they can stump up an equivalent amount to stop Adam Smith’s invisible hand from throttling their shonky cronies in the banking sector. Such extraordinary sums, if devoted to public transport or alternative energies or scores of other socially useful outlays, would go a long way to ending America’s dependence on carbon fuels.</p>

<p>Yet, when it comes to climate change &#8212; which, like, only threatens the viability of the one planet we have &#8212; there’s no option but to let market forces do their work.</p>

<p>Future generations (if indeed there are any) won’t know whether to laugh or to cry.</p></blockquote>
