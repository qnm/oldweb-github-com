title: Goodbye, Dr. Moog
excerpt: Robert Moog, inventor of the Theremin and the creator of the synthesizer that bears his name passed away at 71, four months after being diagnosed with brain cancer. As a fan of electronic music, it's pretty safe to say that without him, music would not be where it is today.

Robert Moog, creator of the synthesizer that bears his name, passed away at 71, four months after being diagnosed with brain cancer. As a fan of electronic music, it's pretty safe to say that without him, music would not be where it is today.

His inventions have been used by many musicians over the years, and can be heard on tracks by artists as diverse as the Beach Boys ('Good Vibrations'), Herbie Hancock, Yes and pretty much every electronic artist out there.

Rest In Peace. Your contribution to modern music will not be forgotten.
