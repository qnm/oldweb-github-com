A few of my collegues are delving into XSLT now, and a lot are still writing transforms procedural stylee. I&apos;ve found <a href="http://www.computorcompanion.com/LPMArticle.asp?ID=202">a gentle introduction</a> into how to create tables with a specified number of columns from a list of unknown length, with an elegant declarative solution. If you&apos;re new to XSLT, it&apos;s worth a look.
