I've been toying with the idea of a corporate Jabber server for a while now, but it's just another server to administer...

Enter <a href="http://www.jivesoftware.org/wildfire/">Wildfire Server</a> - a great looking Java based server that runs of OXS, Winders and Linux. It looks a lot simpler to set up than jabberd, so I might let it loose on one of our Win 2000 boxes and see how we get on!
