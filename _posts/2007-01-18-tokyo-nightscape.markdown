I found this incredible HDR shot of Tokyo via BoingBoing. To me, Tokyo is the archetypal cyberpunk metropolis, and seeing the city lit up such vivid colours makes it even more so!<br />

I particularly like the hue of the freeway running through the center of the picture, the neon is particularly 'Bladerunner'.
