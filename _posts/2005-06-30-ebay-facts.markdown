I&apos;m a bit of a fan of <a href="http://www.ebay.com.au">ebay</a>, but <a href="http://www.fortune.com/fortune/articles/0,15114,704026,00.html">this article</a> on Fortune has some interesting facts on Ebay. Did you know...
<ul>
<li>eBay has such high margins partly because it has no factories or inventory, but also because its customers do the work...</li>
<li>If eBay employed the 430,000 people who earn all or most of their income selling on its site, it would be the second-largest employer on the FORTUNE 500, after Wal-Mart...</li>
</ul>
