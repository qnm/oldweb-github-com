            Whilst looking for some performance data on InnoDB tables, I came across <a href="http://mysqluc.com/cs/mysqluc2005/view/e_sess/6257">this presentation</a> from Brad Fitzpatrick of <a href="http://www.livejournal.com">LiveJournal </a>fame, where he talks about the evolution of LiveJournal, from its beginnings as a college project, right up to the blogging behemoth that it is now. It provides a good insight into scaling MySQL from a few users to millions upon millions of users.
