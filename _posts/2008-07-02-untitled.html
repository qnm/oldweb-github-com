<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">The primary service that Gnip offers at launch today is to capture user data updates from any web application and then serve up the very latest information to anyone else who requests it. Your application doesn&#8217;t have to ping Flickr, YouTube, etc. etc. every few minutes and ask &#8220;have any of our users done anything on your individual service?&#8221; Now with Gnip, Flickr (a launch partner in fact) can report user data updates to Gnip, which can then pass that data along to consuming parties, along with data from all the other social media services of interest.</blockquote>
