<p>This is an old invention of mine. I had trouble waking up for work, and traditional alarm clocks didnâ€™t seem to help. I learned to hit the snooze or off buttons in my sleep. The problem was that alarms are too easy to turn off, and so I set forth to create an alarm clock that challenges me to prove that I am awake.</p>
