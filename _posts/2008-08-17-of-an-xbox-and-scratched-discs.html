title: Of an Xbox and scratched discs
published: true

<p>If, like me, you have an xbox 360 that occasionally munches your discs, causing graphical artifacts, problems loading etc. then I may have an answer to fixing the discs, at least.</p>
<p>After chatting with a very helpful girl at my local EB store, she advised me that video rental stores have a magic machine that resurfaces discs. $5 and a trip to my local rental store later, I can play Orange Box again.</p>
<p>In the meantime I&#8217;m keeping a close eye on the xbox and will make sure it goes back to the mothership before the warranty expires.</p>
