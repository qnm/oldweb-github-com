It looks like <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.com/">Ubuntu</a> have now launched '<a href="http://fridge.ubuntu.com/">The Fridge</a>', a site analogous to a family fridge, where you can stick notes and information for everyone to see. Very clever!

The site fits in very nicely with the other Ubuntu sites (i.e. brown), giving it a nice warm and not-too-corporate feel. Ubuntu really have their finger on the pulse when it comes community building. Well done guys (and gals)!
