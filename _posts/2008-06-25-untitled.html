<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">Slate&#8217;s founding editor, Michael Kinsley, once noted to the Financial Times that &#8220;[t]he most common abuse of the semicolon, at least in journalism, is to imply a relationship between two statements without having to make clear what that relationship is.&#8221; All journalists can cop to this: The semicolon allows woozy clauses to lean on each other like drunks for support.</blockquote>
