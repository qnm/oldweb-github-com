<a href="http://zeldman.com">Zeldman</a> pointed me in the direction of <a href="http://www.pixelcharmer.com/fieldnotes/archives/process_designing/2005/000622.html#000622">this blog article</a>, which describes a phenomenon in landscape architecture known as &apos;Lines of Desire&apos;, whereby &apos;users&apos; take a shortcut across grass instead of using a walkway. This is analogous to web site maps, where the way a user wants to navigate somewhere may not be exactly the way the designer intended, <a href="http://www.peterme.com/archives/000073.html">a bit like what happened here</a>. But <a href="http://atomiq.org/archives/2005/02/ceci_nest_pas_un_sentier.html">it isn&apos;t always best letting the user decide.</a>
