A friend of mine that deejays back in Dundee has a fair number of rather good mixes available for download on <a href="http://baked.thecooker.net/">his site</a>.

The latest one meanders through funk, afro-rhythms, broken and a wee bit of house. It's <a href="http://thecooker.net/mp3s/baked-Summer05.mp3">well worth a listen</a>!
