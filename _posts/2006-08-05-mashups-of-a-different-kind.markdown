Over my past few blog articles I've mentioned two musical things (despite having a job in the music industry I tend to blog about techy geek stuff), Solid Steel Radio and fellow expat Scot in Australia, Jonny Faith.

It's rather serendipitous that this weeks (04-08-2006) Solid Steel Radio guestmix is from Jonny Faith, backed by Strictly Kev from DJ Food. Everyone should download a copy, as they're both tremendous talents and you'll love their selection. At least, I did!

Congrats Jonny, keep it unreal!
