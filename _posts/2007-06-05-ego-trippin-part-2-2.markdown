For the third time in as many years, I got my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_minutes_of_fame">fifteen minutes of fame</a> in the <a href="http://www.smh.com.au">Sydney Morning Herald</a>. This time, I was chatting to Simon Sharwood at the <a href="http://code.google.com/events/developerday/au-home.html">Google Developer Day in Sydney</a>, and he called me back yesterday for a wee haver. We talked about quite a few different Googley things, but obviously the stand out of the conversation was this reference to when we'd be adopting Google Gears into our site: <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/biztech/not-all-along-for-ride/2007/06/04/1180809431861.html">"Until everyone that uses Internet Explorer installs it, we are not going to be able to use it"</a>. Of course, I couldn't tell him about the really interesting Google integration we have planned...
