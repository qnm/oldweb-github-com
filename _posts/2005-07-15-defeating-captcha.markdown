Whilst looking into ways of protecting this blog from spam, I learnt a bit about CAPTCHA. CAPTCHA is the system of wibbly letters on coloured backgrounds that are used on many websites to help protect against spam, and does a pretty good of it too, despite being completely inaccessible. A few sites have worked around this by providing audio samples of the CAPTCHA message, although I think this is more of a fudge than a solution to spam.

I also came across a very interesting article about <a href="http://www.brains-n-brawn.com/default.aspx?vDir=aicaptcha">how the CAPTCHA system can be defeated</a>, using neural net technology to allow the computer to 'read' the message. Whilst no code has been released, the concept looks to be quite convincing.
