We've all heard of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/online/weblogs/story/0,14024,1388466,00.html">bloggers getting sacked</a>, but could affect you getting a job too?

<a href="http://chronicle.com/jobs/2005/07/2005070801c.htm">An article in the Chronicle</a> seems to suggest that it certainly might not help. Mind you, I guess that depends on what kind of stuff you keep in your blog. The stuff I have here tends to be inoffensive, and probably uninteresting at best!
