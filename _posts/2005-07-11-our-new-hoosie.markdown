We got it for a little under the asking price, but for what seems to us like a very good price for a nice place in a nice area. I've put up some pics in <a href="http://sharp.id.au/gallery.php">The Gallery</a>, so you can <a href="http://www.sharp.id.au/gallery.php?album=567977">look at our new home!</a>
