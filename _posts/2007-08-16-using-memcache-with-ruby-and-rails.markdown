Last night I gave a wee talk at the <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com.au/">Ruby On Rails Oceania</a> meetup in Sydney about Memcached and how we use it at The Sound Alliance, in addition to how it can be used in Ruby and Rails. I've uploaded the pdf of the slides, so if you like you can download my talk on <a href="http://www.sharp.id.au/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/memcachedtalk.pdf" title="Memcached on Rails">Memcached on Rails</a>. Look out for a screencast over the coming weeks.
