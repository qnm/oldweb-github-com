<a href="http://www.treehugger.com">Treehugger </a>reports (via <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-1743819,00.html">The Times</a>) that Queen Elizabeth (that's with a zed, thanks) has installed geothermal heating at Buckingham Palace. Whilst not the first castle to go geothermal, it's a good example of what can be done to both lower heating costs and help the environment.
