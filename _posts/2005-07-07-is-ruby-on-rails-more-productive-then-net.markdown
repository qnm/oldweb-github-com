<a href="dema.ruby.com.br">Dema</a> seems to think so. He estimates that his .net development could be  roughly 3 times faster using a framework similar to that provided by Ruby-On-Rails. Check out <a href=" http://dema.ruby.com.br/articles/2005/07/05/do-yourself-a-favor-get-a-good-framework">his article</a> and see for yourself.

Updated: Thanks for your comments Dema.
