If you're a PHP guru based in London, you could do much worse than work for<a href="http://www.last.fm"> last.fm</a>. They're after a <a href="http://www.last.fm/about/jobs/#job0">PHP Developer with all the usual skills</a>. If I was in London I'd like to work there. But I'm in Sydney. Where the sun shines and beaches have sand. Yay for Sydney!
