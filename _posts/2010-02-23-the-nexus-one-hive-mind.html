<blockquote class="posterous_long_quote">I turned my phone to vibrate and went to bed the other night, when I woke up, I saw that <a href="http://reinventingerica.com/">my good friend Erica O&rsquo;Grady had called</a>. Now, this isn&rsquo;t revolutionary. Erica and I talk all of the time. What was revolutionary is that, being that this is a new phone, I hadn&rsquo;t programmed Erica&rsquo;s information into it. On any other phone, it would have shown up as just a number and I would have had to wrack my brain for who that was (I rely heavily on digital address books). But because Erica has her information entered into her Google account, it showed her photo, her number, her email, her location and everything else she has given the g00g.</blockquote>

<p>Whilst an incredibly useful feature, Tara's example really shows us how much information we've given up to Google, and to other online companies.</p>
