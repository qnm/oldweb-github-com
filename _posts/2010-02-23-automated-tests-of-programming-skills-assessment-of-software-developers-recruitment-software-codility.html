    <p>"Automated recruitment test reduces the cost of screening of a programmer. Recruitment testing decreases the amount of interview work by up to 90% by requesting the candidate to write a snippet of a code in an online assessment tool. It also allows the recruiter to test employee in a natural working environment."</p></div>
