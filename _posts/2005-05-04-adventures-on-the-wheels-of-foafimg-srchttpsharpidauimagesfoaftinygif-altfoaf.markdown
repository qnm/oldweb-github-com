I&apos;ve finally set up <a href="http://www.foaf-project.org/">FOAF</a> on my site, using Leigh Dodds&apos; <a href="http://www.ldodds.com/foaf/foaf-a-matic.html">Foaf-a-matic</a> to create the base RDF. You can <a href="http://xml.mfd-consult.dk/foaf/explorer/?foaf=http%3A%2F%2Fsharp.id.au%2Ffoaf.rdf">explore my FOAF file</a> if you want to. Now what am I going to do? Well hopefully someone reading this will also use FOAF, and they can link in to me. I was quite intrigued by <a href="http://www.orkut.com">orkut</a> when it first came out, but it&apos;s been quite slow and a bit unreliable recently. I wish there was a way to turn my orkut friends list in to a FOAF file... watch this space.
