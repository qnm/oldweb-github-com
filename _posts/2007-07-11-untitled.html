<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote"><p>Ingenious software is simple. Simplicity is the heart of the Unix philosophy. The more code lines you have removed, the more progress you have made. As the number of lines of code in your software shrinks, the more skilled you have become and the less your software sucks.</p>

<p>In other words: Removed code is debugged code, and it certainly doesn&#8217;t use any memory or CPU time; so even better if you don&#8217;t write it.</p></blockquote>
