<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">Developers can access any publicly available profile data from a MySpace user and integrate it into their site. This includes a userâ€™s name, picture, bio, social graph (list of friends), and other information. Users authorize the data transfer via a one-time secure OAuth login to MySpace from the third party service. The service is then allowed to access the data.</blockquote>
