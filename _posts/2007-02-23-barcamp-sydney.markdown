There will be a <a href="http://thesoundalliance.net/">Sound Alliance</a> presence at this years <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampSydney">Sydney BarCamp</a>, both <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/home_spun/">Ian</a> and I will be going. We probably won't present, but we'll certainly cause a stramash

I think we'll also be going to <a href="http://webjam.com.au/">WebJam,</a> which looks pretty good too!
