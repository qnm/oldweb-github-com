<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">Ask management if it&#8217;s worth a few hundred thousand dollars in lost staff time to put made-up terms in the intranet menus. Usually it isn&#8217;t, particularly because you&#8217;ll likely be asked to remove the fancy terminology next year â€” probably just after people have finally gotten used to it. Stick to long-term terminology for navigation labels. These labels are the most costly words in the company in terms of the number of hours employees will spend pondering their meaning.</blockquote>
