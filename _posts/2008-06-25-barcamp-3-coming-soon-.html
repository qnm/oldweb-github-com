<p>Hello Campers!</p>
<p>It’s that time of the year again – BarCampSydney3 is almost upon us! This year it’s hosted at the Roundhouse at UNSW on Anzac Parade, and as ever there’s “No spectators, only participants”.</p>
<p>Be prepared to get involved with BarCamp, everyone has something to give and BarCamp gives you an ideal forum to find other like-minded geeks to bounce your thoughts and ideas off.</p>
<p>You can get more info regarding the BarCamp concept, transport to the venue, and much much more at <a href="http://www.barcampsydney.org/">http://www.barcampsydney.org/</a></p>
