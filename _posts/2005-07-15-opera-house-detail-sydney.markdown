I've started using <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/quannum/">Flickr</a> to store my photo gallery, as lots of my UK-based friends are using it and I can easily see what they are up to. I logged in today, and checked the recent activity, and other than a comment about Ramsey Street for Mr. Barker (very good, sir!) <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/nimbinferal/">someone</a> had marked the photo above as one of their favourites! I took it ages ago when I was backpacking with my little Olympus mju 2, which is still a fantastic little camera.
