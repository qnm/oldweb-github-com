<a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/view/jamesh/2006/09/14/0">James Henstridge</a> noticed the similarity between <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200609/s1741675.htm">recent political debate</a> on immigration and the '<a href="http://www.snpp.com/episodes/3F20.html">Much Apu about nothing</a>' episode from The Simpsons.

<blockquote> <strong>Moe</strong>: You know what really aggravazes me?  It's them immigants.  They wants all the benefits of living in Springfield, but they ain't even bother to learn themselves the language.

<strong>Homer</strong>: Hey, those are exactly my sentimonies.</blockquote>

Substitute Moe for Howard, Homer for Beazley and Springfield for Australia, and you pretty much  sum things up.
