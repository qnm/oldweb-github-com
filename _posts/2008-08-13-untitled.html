<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">Somewhat sick of the replays aired on Seven&#8217;s coverage of the Beijing games I wandered out into the pastures of the interwebs to see what was on offer. Given the commercial realities of Olympics broadcasting (i.e. no one has the right to stream anything without forking over $10 gazillion dollars) the natural first stop was the grand puppet master of Olympic event scheduling - NBC. I went to nbc.com, found my way to the NBC Olympics website and was pleasantly surprised at what was on offer. So pleasantly surprised I&#8217;d go so far to say they&#8217;ve done a fantastic job.</blockquote>
