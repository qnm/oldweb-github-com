Happy New Year everyone! Last night was spent at Luna Park, courtesy of comp tickets from my work.<br />
<br />
Things we did:<br />
<ul>
<li>Watched the kiddies fireworks at 9pm - very cool, but nothing compared with what's to come</li>
<li>Rode on the Wild Mouse, a very small rollercoaster that threw us around 90o corners at very high speed. The bruises are starting to show.</li>
<li>Had a 'few' drinks...</li>
<li>Watched some of Ajax' set. Always good.</li>
<li>Watched the NY fireworks from a fantastic viewpoint (as per the photo). They had to be the most amazing fireworks display I'd ever seen. Absolutely awesome!</li>
</ul>
More pics from the evening are in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/quannum/">my flickr feed</a> - I borrowed Sam's camera 'cos I didn't want to take my 'big' camera and didn't work out the exposure setting until later in the evening. I wish I'd found it earlier :-$<br />
<br />
Have a great 2006 everyone!
