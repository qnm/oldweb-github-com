title: Installing Fedora 13 via USB boot disk
published: true
---
<p>After many attempts to get Fedora 13 onto my Asus EEE 1005HE netbook, I finally cracked it. This is something of a note bene for me, but hopefully it'll help someone else too. For the search spiders, the error you will see will be "installer has tried to mount image #1". Sadly, the live cd kept failing on install, even though it was checksum verified to be a valid download.</p>
<ol>
<li>Grab the DVD image from <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/get-fedora">Fedora</a>
</li>
<li>Use the <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FedoraLiveCD/USBHowTo">Live CD Creator</a> to build an image from the ISO.</li>
<li>As you've only got a 4Gb drive, delete the RPM and Repo directories, as the installer seems to ignore them anyway.</li>
<li>Copy over the Fedora 13 DVD ISO to the root of the drive.</li>
<li>Boot from USB, and install Fedora goodness!</li>
</ol>
