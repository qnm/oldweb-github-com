title: AW Stats uncovering dns badness

I&apos;ve added awstats to my server so I can keep track of who&apos;s visiting and stuff (thanks to <a href="http://ibao.hopto.org/blog/debian/archives/2004/10/awstats_web_log.html">this guide</a>), and for some reason, I seem to be getting hits from <a href="http://zelenski.net">this domain.</a> Very odd. I think I&apos;ll contact the owners...
