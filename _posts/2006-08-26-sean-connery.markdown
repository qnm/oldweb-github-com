I got an email from Sean Connery the other day.

I was wondering what Sean would ask me about, being a fellow Scotsman, and I guessed he might want some advice on whisky, or how to handle all his adoring female fans. Perhaps he was getting into development and needed some advice on replicating servers?

Alas, he only wanted to sell me some pharmaceuticals that would 'ensure my most excellent performance'. Shame!
