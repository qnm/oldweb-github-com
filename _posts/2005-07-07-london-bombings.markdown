I'm watching the news of multiple bombings in London on the news between texting London friends to check that they're okay. I really can't believe what's happened.

One of the most worrying things is this quote from <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/4659243.stm">eyewitness reports</a> on <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/">BBC News</a>

<blockquote>"I was helping a member of the public with directions when the bus stopped and the driver asked me the name of the street. I told him Tavistock Square and he called me over.

"Just as I was about to go, I heard the bus explode"</blockquote>
