<p>Michael Phelps’ finish last night in the 100 fly was truly spectacular.  I just watched it on Tivo.  I used to swim competitively when I was young.  Butterfly was my best stroke, but these guys are in an entirely different league.  Based on the top photo, it’s hard to see how Phelps (on the left) could win, yet he somehow managed to touch the wall before Serbia’s Cavic (on the right).  How is that even possible?</p>
