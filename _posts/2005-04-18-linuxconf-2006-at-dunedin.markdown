So, it looks like next years <a href="http://lca2006.linux.org.au/">linuxconf</a> will be held in the Edinburgh of the South, <a href="http://www.cityofdunedin.com/cover.htm">Dunedin</a>, one of the few places outside of Scotland where there is a statue of <a href="http://www.robertburns.org/">Rabbie Burns</a>, our national poet.
