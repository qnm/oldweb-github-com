<span class="title">Engineering Manager</span> Media Properties<br/>
<span class="org">Yahoo!</span> <span class="location">Sydney, NSW, Australia</span>
</div>
<div style="clear: both">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="description"><p>Promoted to this role in October 2008, I oversee a team of six full-time and contract engineers, giving them the help and breathing space they need to get their jobs done.</p>

<p>Bridging production and engineering, I ensure that functional and technical requirements are reasonable and achievable, whilst providing air cover to the team to ensure the deadlines we set are kept.</p>

<p>Awareness of i18n and l10n issues helped deliver software for multiple territories, plus my strong web technologies background helped us integrate semantic data in the properties, for SEO and machine-readable data benefit.</p>

<p>The team has had a number of successful - both in the technical and audience - projects, which are viewable below</p>

<dl>
<dt><a href="http://au.tv.yahoo.com">http://au.tv.yahoo.com</a> - Engineer and Manager</dt>
<dd>The impetus for modular reusability, this site allowed allowed our production staff to create 13 individually styled show microsites in less than two weeks. The refreshed Home and Away site contained online video and galleries, along with UGC elements such as commenting and rating, both increasing user engagement and vastly increasing PV and session time in both Australia and overseas.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://au.food.yahoo.com">http://au.food.yahoo.com</a> - Engineer and Manager</dt>
<dd>This site aggregated data from our content partners and presented it to the user in a cookbook friendly way including a cookbook view, allowing for the printing of A5 paper cards, commenting and rating.</dd>
<dd>We have extensively integrated microformats into the site, allowing for increased SEO from both Yahoo! and Google, who support the reading of structured semantic data</dd>

<dt><a href="http://au.movies.yahoo.com">http://au.movies.yahoo.com</a> - Manager</dt>
<dd>A complete revamp of our aging movies property, this site allowed the integration of multiple content providers across multiple localities, yet left control in the hands of production, allowing incredible flexibility in rendering. This was essential to build promotional microsites within the property, with minimal engineering intervention.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Prior to that, I was a software engineer. Coding for both frontend and backend, I develop in PHP5, helped by the automated testing capabilities of PHPUnit, I adhere to the standards of XHML and CSS, and enhance web behaviour though Javascript using the YUI toolkit.</p>

</div>

<div class="skills">Key technologies include PHP5, XSLT, PHPUnit, RESTful Web Services, Hudson, Apache configuration, Squid ACL Configuration. Key skills include ensuring timely project delivery, requirement scop refinement, maintaining staff motivation and building good software engineers into great ones.

<div class="description"><p>Leading a team of 5, I helped build 3 of Australia's largest community websites into MVC'-based scalable and maintainable platforms, all operating from a single codebase.This was possible through the use of Memcache to provide a partitioned, distributed data cache, SVN branches to separate our feature and maintenance cycles, continuous integration and test-driven development strategies to ensure each release was better than the last.</p>

<p>Performance was also a key issue, so PHP profiling with XDebug, MySQL query analysis and Memcache statistics allowed us clarity of how much work remained to be done.</p>
</div>
<dl class="achievements">
<dt>Key achievements include:</dt>
<dd>Architecture of a proven CMS and content delivery platform that scales well and delivers millions of pages to eager community members, through very modest hardware requirements</dd>
<dd>Architecture of a gallery platform that outperforms the most popular open-source by several margins, through use of a de-normalised schema and in-memory caching</dd>
<dd>Instilling best practices into the team to ensure high product quality - such as test-driven development, continuous integration and fail-safe measures such as syntax checking upon version control checking.</dd>
<dd>Successful and on-time releases of some of the busiest music and community sites in Australia. inthemix.com.au is now the most-viewed music website in Australia, according to Nielson Norman Netratings.</dd>
