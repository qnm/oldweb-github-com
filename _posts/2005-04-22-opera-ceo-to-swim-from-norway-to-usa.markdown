Not sure whether I believe <a href="http://opera.com/pressreleases/en/2005/04/21/">this press release</a> or not, but CEO of Opera, Jon S. von Tetzchner reckons he&apos;ll <a href="http://opera.com/pressreleases/en/2005/04/21/">swim from Norway to the USA</a> when (if!) Opera 8 hits 1 million downloads within 4 days of its release. I downloaded it, perhaps you should give it a try? It&apos;s the only choice for mobile web development...
