It looks like Google Local has expanded to the UK, and in case you were wondering how too see <a href="http://local.google.co.uk/local?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=football&amp;near=Dundee&amp;btnG=Search&amp;sc=1">both football teams in Dundee</a>...

Looks like a pretty useful service, hopefully not too long until we see an Aussie version.
