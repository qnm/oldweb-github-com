Last night, the <a href="http://www.thesoundalliance.net">TSA</a> tech posse went on tour to <a href="http://www.webjam.com.au">Webjam3</a>, Sydney's premier 3-minute web presentation evening.

Of course, we had a vested interest in the evening, as our very own <a href="http://this.isnot.tv">Aaron Wallis</a> was presenting the <a href="http://www.samesame.com.au">Samesame</a><a href="http://this.isnot.tv"> </a> viral, <a href="http://www.samesame.com.au/yesprimeminister">Yes, Prime Minister</a>. His presentation was excellent, with some risque bullet points, LOLcats, and a cartoon John Howard saying pretty much anything you like!

In second place was Webjam2 winner, <a href="http://mrspeaker.webeisteddfod.com/">Mr. Speaker</a>, but the real star of the evening was Mr. HTML5, <a href="http://lachy.id.au">Lachlan Hunt</a>, who provided us with an insight into the HTML5 video tag, followed by the <a href="http://lachy.id.au/log/2007/06/webjam3">best Spice Girls lipsync and dance evah!</a>

Being the nerds we are, we also caught up with <a href="http://www.twitter.com">twitter</a> buddy, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/Synapse">Synapse</a>, and had a good yarn about many things, including a possible Webjam4 entry!

Afterwards, in true TSA style, we then headed off to Yu to see Tiga and Bangang and grabbed a few beers whilst we were there.
