title: The elusive media centre...

I've been looking into building a media centre for ages now, and have got as far as buying a hifi-sized cased and started playing with various bits of software. So far I've looked into:

* <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a> - pretty decent, but a little flaky and has a million and one dependencies. I also had problems loading OzTivo data into it's EPG.

* <a href="http://www.team-mediaportal.com/">Media Portal</a> - again, pretty good, but seemed to run really slowly, even on my Athlon 64 3200. That could well be a configuration thing though.

But then on Friday just past, we took delivery of an <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">Intel Mac Mini</a> for our office (on the grounds of browser testing), and I was sold! We have:

* The tiniest box ever, with really low power consumption, something my Athlon-based box couldn't compete with
* Builtin remote, wireless and DVI and digital audio output, and a reasonable all-in price tag

With Front Row, it's great for recorded media. But what about the TV recording part? A little research turned up the <a href="http://www.elgato.com/index.php?file=products_eyetvdtt">Elgato EyeTV for DTT</a> tuner, which now integrates into Front Row. Now that sounds good! The final piece of the puzzle was the ever problematic Australian EPG. For this I'm going to try out <a href="http://www.icetv.com.au/">IceTV</a> using the <a href="http://www.islayer.net/index.php?op=item&id=16">IceTV widget</a>.

I'm going to hang onto the STB for a little while longer, but it looks like the Mac Mini is a winner for my living room media center!
