<p>via <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2009/06/mit-students-build-a-speedy-go-kart-out-of-a-shopping-cart/">gizmodo</a> &ldquo;When you were in college, you spent your free time drinking tallboys of Bud Ice and playing Mario Kart 64 until 5am. These MIT students, on the other hand, built a shopping cart go-kart cart and dubbed it the LOLriokart.</p>
<p>The LOLrioKart consists of a big stack of NiCd aircraft batteries and a 15hp brushless motor rigged up to an old shopping cart with upgraded wheels. As you can see by the video, it travels at a pretty good clip, up to 72kph. And you&rsquo;ve got to assume that in Cambridge, seeing a motorised shopping cart with a nerd inside tooling around on the street isn&rsquo;t all that shocking.&rdquo;</p>
