<p>With all the recent furore around Facebook privacy, I've been looking at various online services I use, and seeing how well they support SSL. Twitter is probably the winner here, as they send <em>everything</em> over https once you modify the URL. I did however read that their SSL certificate may be insecure due to using the md5 signing method. More on twitter later</p>
<p>Facebook start off well. You can jump over to https easily, and they have a nicely signed ceritificate. Sadly, that's where the fun ends. All links on the page are absolute, and lead straight back to http land. As a user, I'm confused by the warnings, and would have a false sense of security without knowledge of having moved from https to http. Still, I'll keep my fingers crossed they fix that particular schoolboy error soon.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Someone else is having similar thoughts, as the <a href="https://eff.org">EFF</a> have just launched the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/06/encrypt-web-https-everywhere-firefox-extension">HTTPS Everywhere</a> Firefox extension. However, I still believe that Facebook need to fix their link strategy.</p>
<p>Now, if only we can get a Chrome extension to do the same thing!</p>
