Whilst I thought I would never buy another Nokia product, the magic words &apos;Debian&apos;, &apos;Linux&apos; and &apos;Open Development Platform&apos; may yet change my mind. According to <a href="http://www.mobileburn.com/review.jsp?Id=1376">Mobileburn</a> the device has an ARM based processor and is based on <a href="http://gnome.org">GNOME!</a> <a href="http://ometer.com/">Havoc</a> mentioned <a href="http://http://www.maemo.org/">Maemo</a> on the desktop-devel-list and the vibe about the platform seems to be positive.
Update: Looks like <a href="http://www.gnome.org/~jdub/blog/projects/gnome/1117031356">Jeff has blogged about it too</a>
