For all the good that comes out of using Google&apos;s Accelerator, theres always going to be problems. It stated with people noticing that things were being deleted from their <a href="http://www.backpackit.com/">Backpacks</a>, but it seems its a little more widespread. Now, whilst I would never (well, probably never) do something as outlandish as <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html">delete from a GET request</a>, I can&apos;t say that no-one has. I&apos;d guess I&apos;d <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/netlib/Link_Prefetching_FAQ.html">better prepare</a>! I found  out about this using <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/google_web_accelerator_hey_not_so_fast_an_alert_for_web_app_designers.php">this lively discussion</a>
