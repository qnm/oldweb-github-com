            I tried out Flock a while back and was very impressed with its blogging interface, but was less than impressed with it's stability, so I was pretty happy to learn that there's a nice blogging editor available as a Firefox extension.

It's called Performancing, and I'm articleing from it now. You should <a href="http://performancing.com/firefox">give it a try</a>!
