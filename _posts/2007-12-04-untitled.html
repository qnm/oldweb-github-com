<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote"><p>&#8220;Moving the development of our most capital intensive efforts under the wings of our phototropic foundation helps the business too,&#8221; said Schmidt.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s wonderful that our number one resource issue blocking global domination can be spun off as our selfless efforts to save the world from impending doom AND kept in a different accounts.  It&#8217;s genius - we save the world through developing best-of-class technology that we need to figure out anyway, then the world thanks us for saving the environment, then we charge them through the nose to use our technology.  This really supports our efforts to have more money than God.&#8221;</p>

<p>Page added, &#8220;It&#8217;s not evil - it&#8217;s genius.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
