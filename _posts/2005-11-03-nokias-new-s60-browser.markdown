title: Nokia's new S60 browser

It's been almost a year since stopped developing for mobile platforms, and how things have changed since then!

<a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com">Russell Beattie</a> linked to a flash-based <a href="http://www.series60.com/browser">demonstration of the new Nokia S60-based browser</a>. It's based on KDE's Konquerer, the same codebase that Apple use for Safari, and looks tremendous. I especially like the zoom-out navigation - Opera always did well with rendering large pages on small screens, but obviously processing power is now such that pages can be visually manipulated to provide truly usable navigation.
