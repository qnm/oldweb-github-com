Not content with blogging, toolbars, local maps etc., <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> have launched the <a href="http://webaccelerator.google.com/">Web Accelerator</a>, which routes requests through their servers to speed things up. Whilst this sounds wonderful, I&apos;m not convinced I want all of my requests going through their servers... *places tin foil hat on head*
